    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my webpage. My name is Kennieth. I am a first-year college student taking up BSIT. This diary is where I share my experiences, thoughts, and journey as a student.</p>
    <p>College life is full of learning, challenges, and fun experiences. Every day brings something new to explore. So come with me and let's see my story as I grow, learn, and experience college life one step at a time.</p>

    <h2>Why I Chose BSIT</h2>
    <p>I chose BSIT because I am interested in technology and computers. I enjoy learning how websites and programs work. This course helps me understand how technology can solve problems and help people.</p>

    <h2>College Life</h2>
    <p>College life is a mix of learning, challenges, and new experiences. Every day, I learn something new not only in my subjects but also in life. There are times when lessons are difficult, deadlines are stressful, and managing time becomes hard.</p>
    <p>Some challenges I face include understanding new topics, balancing schoolwork, and adjusting to college life. Even when things feel difficult, I remind myself that these challenges help me grow and become stronger.</p>
    <p>Through patience, practice, and continuous learning, I am slowly improving my skills. Someday, I want to become a successful web developer who can create useful and meaningful websites. This journey may not be easy, but I am willing to learn, improve, and move forward step by step.</p>
